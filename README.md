# MatrixExercises
Implemented various algorithms that work with matrixes, using both vectors and lists.

- Mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication;
- Custom matrix shapes: box, spiral, snake;
- Resource harvester: given a certain path, the harvester collects all the resources and at the end it prints out the amount of resources gathered and the most visited squares from the matrix.
